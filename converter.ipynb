Minor ones are usually quick bug fixes performed and released with zero downtime on the system. 2. Bi Monthly: We release the updates Bi Monthly (we have the sprint every 2 weeks) on the platform, and if required, we can share the release notes with the customer. 3. If any major release involves any downtime, then a two week prior notice is provided to the customers. In most cases, the releases happen with zero downtime. 4. There are two types of releases: The platform release and the Product Release. The platform release is applicable across multiple clients and will get implemented for all the customers. The product release is around the improved operational processes and hence not mandatory for the customer to adopt (Even though we would recommend that upgrade as the new processes will be an enhanced version of the previous one.

The AWS cloud supports popular disaster recovery (DR) architecture of hot standby environments that enable rapid failover at scale. With data centres in regions worldwide, AWS provides a set of cloud based disaster recovery services that will allow quick recovery of your IT infrastructure and data. 1. Shiprocket runs in a multi zone AWS environment, which guarantees high resiliency and maintains two copies of data across different availability zones. The maximum duration for IT service resumption after the service outage for RTO is 6 hours to 24 hours. 2. Shiprocket uses Amazons RDS Multi AZ deployments to provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When Shiprocket provisions a Multi AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora) so that Shiprocket can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Shiprocket also takes regular backups (RPO) every day at 00:00. These snapshots will be restored as RPO in case of DR. Maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost due to the service outage is 24 hours for RPO.

Shiprocket runs in a multi zone AWS environment, which guarantees high resiliency and maintains two copies of data across different availability zones. The maximum duration for IT service resumption after the service outage for RTO is 6 hours to 24 hours. 2. Shiprocket uses Amazons RDS Multi AZ deployments to provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When Shiprocket provisions a Multi AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora) so that Shiprocket can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Shiprocket also takes regular backups (RPO) every day at 00:00. These snapshots will be restored as RPO in case of DR.
